        // 1) syntax errors which prevent the code from even compiling
        // 2) runtime errors which cause the code to crash or not give the expected result
        // syntax errors can be easily fixed using while using IDE like IntelliJ IDEA
        // runtime errors are more difficult to track down and to help we can use a debugger
        // In the real world applications should be tested before being deployed
        // after making sure the code is working as expected we can deploy it as a jar
        // and distribute it
